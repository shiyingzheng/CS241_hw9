=========
Shiying Zheng and Ben Stern

Encode: encodes files using the huffman algorithm.
Decode: decodes files using the huffman algorithm.

linkedlist.h and linkedlist.c are the files for constructing linkedlists.
sortedlist.c and sortedlist.h are for the sortedlist based on linkedlists.
huffmantree.c and huffmantree.h are the files for constructing huffmantrees. 
huffmantree_test.c  sortedlist_test.c are the test files for sortedlist and huffmantree.
decode.c is the program to decode files.
encode.c is the program to encode files.

No bugs, a lot of good data structures!

Time spent on the assignment: A LOT. We think more than 20 hours.

Interesting designs: linkedlist and sortedlist are not only good for this assignment, but for future use, too!

No warnings and no valgrind errors.
